        I was lucky enough to intern for <a href="http://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a> in 2009 as part of the technical effects team working on the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/">Up</a>! My main project was working on a rigid body physics simulation plugin for <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/overview">Maya</a> built atop the open-source <a href="http://www.ode.org/">ODE</a> physics engine. Pixar has an entire team dedicated to procedurally-generating effects that would either be too difficult to hand-animate, too time-consuming, or for effects which need to look realistic.

         The ballons in Up, for instance, posed a particularly interesting challenge, because in order for the audience to believe in the magic behind the story of a house being able to fly with thousands of balloons, the balloons and strings had to look realistic but also be very directable in terms of following creative input for any given scene. My work sat directly between trying to reconcile these two conflicting goals of precise controllability and realistic physical simulation, the latter of which is traditionally very difficult to tweak since small changes in the simulation's input can cause large changes in the behavior of the resulting simulation output. The other difficulty we faced was the long, offline computational complexity of such a large simulation and the tedious tweak-run simulation-view result-repeat work cycle that's common to anyone who's done offline rendering or particle simulations, making it particularly difficult to iterate on a given scene's particle simulation (though Pixar's distributed renderfarm certainly helped!).

        Each 3-5 second scene was split up into a separate physics simulation, and each of the 10-20 thousand balloons (depending on the scene) were modeled as two vertically stacked rigid sphere bodies, so the actual simulation was detecting collisions between these spheres and not the end-of-day balloon shapes that go through shading. All of the balloons were also constrained by a string connecting their base sphere to the top of a house stand-in which has already been animated with pre-baked world-space movement for that particular clip such that the ODE simulation's coordinate space would match up with the rest of the scene's world coordinate space when the resulting balloon particle positions were exported back into the rest of the pipeline for further processing. Each string was comprised of a series of simple spring constraints connected to act like a string.

        The plugin to Maya was a visual wrapper around the functionality of ODE, with Pixar pipeline-specific tools and assumptions. It exposed the ability to import a given scene, add different types of forces and adjust their parameters (e.g., wind force, gravity force, vortex force, etc.) and view simulation previews and the results of offline simulations.

        The other, smaller project I worked on while at Pixar was another plugin for Maya to allow for OpenGL previews of proprietary Pixar particle simulations within Maya itself. Maya certainly supports this type of previews for its built-in particle simulations, but Pixar uses a lot of third-party and in-house tools and has a very complicated content pipeline, and previously artists working on nuancing many types of particle simulations in Maya could only view stand-in spheres as opposed to the end-of-day models they were actually animating. For many simple simulations that are more about the particle dynamics than the visuals, that works fine, but it's fairly limiting when you're viewing hundreds or thousands of spheres and trying to visualize what the dynamic system will look like after swapping in the correct model assets. My plugin was aimed at ensuring artists could preview any wireframe meshes of any models in particle systems. Here's a screenshot of the plugin in action for a mock particle simulation from Up, including models of Carl Fredricksen and generic spheres.
